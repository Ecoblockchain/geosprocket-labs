This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to: (i) provide additional financing in an aggregate amount of US$52 million to the EP3. The additional financing would provide needed bridge financing to 33 protected areas covering 2.7 million hectares for the next three years, with a focus on surveillance and implementation of safeguards-related activities. Four additional protected areas will be included in the additional financing: two national parks in the northeast where illegal logging is the most intense and two forestry corridors with high potential to generate carbon revenues and where support is required to address social issues. The additional financing will simultaneously support the creation of sustainable financing mechanisms and promotion of longer-term community development. As presently designed, the additional financing offers a unique opportunity to tackle poverty in remote rural areas surrounding the 33 protected areas - where around 200,000 households live in absolute poverty without the direct involvement of a central government, which has yet to be recognized by the African union commission, and the international community at large.","theme1":{"Name":"Biodiversity","Percent":40},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0001053444","geoLocName":"Zahamena Strict Nature Reserve","latitude":"-17.70192","longitude":"48.91457","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0001055040","geoLocName":"Tsaratanana Strict Nature Reserve","latitude":"-13.89408","longitude":"48.84041","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0001063002","geoLocName":"Lokobe Strict Nature Reserve","latitude":"-13.39917","longitude":"48.31833","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0001067366","geoLocName":"Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve","latitude":"-18.66667","longitude":"44.75139","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0001069218","geoLocName":"Tsingy de Namoroka Strict Nature Reserve","latitude":"-16.46667","longitude":"45.33333","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0006941993","geoLocName":"Andasibe-Mantadia National Park","latitude":"-18.83473","longitude":"48.45881","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0006942110","geoLocName":"Masoala National Park","latitude":"-15.30028","longitude":"50.0525","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007910440","geoLocName":"Zahamena Ankeniheny Forest Corridor","latitude":"-18.29913","longitude":"48.64346","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932407","geoLocName":"Ankarana Reserve","latitude":"-13.07278","longitude":"48.91472","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932408","geoLocName":"Andohahela National Park","latitude":"-24.60083","longitude":"46.69944","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932409","geoLocName":"Analamerana Reserve","latitude":"-12.78765","longitude":"49.53007","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932410","geoLocName":"Ambohitantely Reserve","latitude":"-18.16666","longitude":"47.28334","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932411","geoLocName":"Ambatovaky Reserve","latitude":"-16.76468","longitude":"49.22849","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932414","geoLocName":"Baie de Baly National Park","latitude":"-16.08333","longitude":"45.23333","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932417","geoLocName":"Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park","latitude":"-18.6667","longitude":"44.75","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932418","geoLocName":"Cape Saint Marie Special Reserve","latitude":"-25.58227","longitude":"45.1496","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932420","geoLocName":"Fandrina Vondrozo Forest Corridor","latitude":"-21.65428","longitude":"47.39546","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932421","geoLocName":"Mikea National Park","latitude":"-22.33754","longitude":"43.35098","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932422","geoLocName":"Isalo National Park","latitude":"-22.558333","longitude":"45.4","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932423","geoLocName":"Makira Forest Corridor","latitude":"-15.23409","longitude":"49.437","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932424","geoLocName":"Mangerivola Reserve","latitude":"-18.18149","longitude":"48.90015","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932427","geoLocName":"Manongarivo Reserve","latitude":"-14.01936","longitude":"48.35907","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932428","geoLocName":"Analamazoatra Reserve","latitude":"-18.93884","longitude":"48.43374","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932429","geoLocName":"Nosy Mangabe Reserve","latitude":"-15.49339","longitude":"49.76772","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932430","geoLocName":"Midongy du Sud National Park","latitude":"-23.70725","longitude":"47.09719","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932431","geoLocName":"Montagne D'Ambre National Park","latitude":"-12.59978","longitude":"49.14238","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932432","geoLocName":"Amber Forest Reserve","latitude":"-12.45228","longitude":"49.19296","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932433","geoLocName":"Nosy Hara National Park","latitude":"-12.23769","longitude":"49.01357","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932434","geoLocName":"Ranomafana National Park","latitude":"-21.36788","longitude":"47.39025","country":"MG"},{"geoLocId":"0007932454","geoLocName":"Sahamalaza -

There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is sustainable management of fisheries resources. The project will support governance reform of fisheries management in the Kenyan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The support will include legislation and regulatory review, capacity building and the strengthening of monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing activities. In addition, this component will also promote research on near-shore fish stocks, and improve the use of near-shore fisheries, including providing assistance to develop more sustainable and profitable fishing practices. The second component of the project is sound management of natural resources. This component aims to improve the sound management and regeneration of natural resources and biodiversity in the coastal and marine environments. A related goal is identifying biodiversity products and markets that will help promote eco-tourism and associated spin-off industries. Vision 2030 articulates the value and future role of natural resources as an economic growth pole in Kenya's future development. The third component of the project is support for alternative livelihoods. This component aims to promote sustainable livelihoods within a sound governance framework that includes: i) spatial planning and land capability mapping to identify environmentally and socially sensitive areas; ii) Integrated Coastal Management (ICM); and iii) compliance with environmental regulations and safeguards. Within this institutional framework, the component aims to support sustainable rural development in geographically focused pilot areas in coastal districts. The fourth component of the project is capacity building, monitoring and evaluation system, project management, communication and Coastal Village Fund (CVF). This component aims to build the project coordination and implementation teams' capacity, promote dialogue amongst national partners and regional stakeholders, develop a communication strategy for development outreach and implement a CVF.","theme1":{"Name":"Rural non-farm income generation","Percent":47},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000180389","geoLocName":"Shimoni","latitude":"-4.636481","longitude":"39.382275","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000180399","geoLocName":"Shimba Hills","latitude":"-4.243576","longitude":"39.389136","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000181619","geoLocName":"Pemba Sub-Location","latitude":"-4.15","longitude":"39.466667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000181678","geoLocName":"Pangani Sub-Location","latitude":"-4.5","longitude":"39.116667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000186298","geoLocName":"Mombasa District","latitude":"-4.02","longitude":"39.666667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000187669","geoLocName":"Marereni Sub-Location","latitude":"-2.866667","longitude":"40.133333","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000189739","geoLocName":"Lamu District","latitude":"-2.083333","longitude":"40.75","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000190106","geoLocName":"Kwale District","latitude":"-4.16667","longitude":"39.16667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000192064","geoLocName":"Kilifi District","latitude":"-3.25","longitude":"39.666667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000200910","geoLocName":"Arabuko Sokoke Forest","latitude":"-3.333333","longitude":"39.866667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0006657038","geoLocName":"Kiunga Marine National Reserve","latitude":"-2.022632","longitude":"41.239256","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667639","geoLocName":"Malindi","latitude":"-3.21","longitude":"40.1","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667652","geoLocName":"Taita Taveta","latitude":"-3.4","longitude":"38.37","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667653","geoLocName":"Tana River","latitude":"-1.5","longitude":"39.5","country":"KE"}]},"P108845":{"id":"P108845","project_name":"Kenya Coastal Development Proejct","boardapprovaldate":"2010-07-27T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"KENYA MARINE AND FISHERIES RESEARCH INSTITUTE","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P108845","theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":55},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000400740","geoLocName":"Coast Province","latitude":"-3","longitude":"39.5","country":"KE"}]},"P121065":{"id":"P121065","project_name":"Malawi additional financing for Social Action Fund  3 APLII","boardapprovaldate":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"14,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF FINANCE (MASAF UNIT)","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P121065","project_abstract":"The objective of the Additional Credit for the Third Social Action Fund - (Local Development Fund Mechanism) Project for Malawi is to improve the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to manage local development.

There are three components to the project. Component one: support to Participatory Development Plan (PDP) investments - this component will contribute to the project development objective by supporting the financing of investments within the PDPs framework which reflect the priority needs of local communities in the project target areas. Component two: support to the development of treated wastewater use for agriculture - the objective of this component is to support the National Program for Wastewater Reuse through the transfer of treated wastewater from the Greater Tunis area towards the interior of the country (south of the Tunisian Dorsal) where demand for water is high. In these areas demand for water is high and treated wastewater will help to increase yields on agricultural land, reduce fluctuations in agricultural production, and enhance adaptation to climate variability and change. Component three: institutional strengthening and awareness raising - the objective of this component is to support the mainstreaming of the Integrated Participatory Approach (IPA) in rural development in the three governorates of Jendouba, Kasserine, and Medenine through institutional strengthening and capacity building of target groups involved in project implementation. The component will also support the implementation of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for project activities and for safeguards, and communication and sensitization on sustainable land management, and environmental issues.","theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":16},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002464794","geoLocName":"Mu?tamadiyat Talah","latitude":"35.5","longitude":"8.5","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0002470086","geoLocName":"Mu?tamadiyat Jundubah","latitude":"36.5","longitude":"8.75","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870273","geoLocName":"Jendouba Nord","latitude":"36.54337","longitude":"8.72472","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870274","geoLocName":"Oued Meliz","latitude":"36.4649","longitude":"8.61108","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870278","geoLocName":"Sidi Makhlouf","latitude":"33.54716","longitude":"10.52673","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870280","geoLocName":"Ben Guerdane","latitude":"32.89938","longitude":"11.20743","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870283","geoLocName":"Djedliane","latitude":"35.64632","longitude":"8.93443","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870284","geoLocName":"Ayoun","latitude":"35.50911","longitude":"8.90541","country":"TN"},{"geoLocId":"0007870300","geoLocName":"Hidra","latitude":"35.55253","longitude":"8.4952","country":"TN"}]},"P112568":{"id":"P112568","project_name":"TUN GEF Second Natural Resources Management","boardapprovaldate":"2010-06-17T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT/THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P112568","project_abstract":"The objective of the Second Natural Resources Management Project for Tunisia is to improve living conditions for rural communities in the project area inter alia by fostering increased access to basic infrastructure and services, sustainable increase of income, improved natural resource management practices and promotion of an integrated approach to community-based development among various stakeholders.

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is improving the irrigation water service. This component aims at providing participating farmers with irrigation service necessary for high efficiency drip irrigation. This will be achieved through: (i) replacing irrigation canals with pressurized systems or adapting existing pressurized systems; and (ii) providing irrigation water on-demand, with a predetermined annual quota according to surface water availability. The component activities will include: detailed studies including topographic works and laboratory tests, technical assistance for works monitoring and control, adapting regulation of main adduction channels including changing hydro-mechanic systems, construction of distribution pipes, including installation of hydraulic equipment, construction or adaptation of pumping stations and various civil works. This component also includes the preparation and signature of water supply contracts between ORMVAs (office regional de mise en valeur Agricole - regional agricultural development office) and farmers. The second component of the project is supporting farmers and their partners. This component aims to improve targeted farmers' access to technology, financing, and agricultural markets. This will be achieved through: (i) provision of technical assistance to ORMVAs to support the farmers and agro processors to develop and enter into partnership agreements aiming at securing markets for high value crops; (ii) provision of technical assistance and equipment to ORMVAs to help for the implementation of the market information system; (iii) provision of technical assistance to the ORMVAs to help farmers to use the new irrigation equipment and to improve their agricultural practices; and (iv) provision of mobile laboratory equipment to ORMVAs to monitor performance of new irrigation systems.

Between September 2007 and August 2008 food prices in Benin increased by an estimated 32 percent. This unprecedented increase in food prices fueled a significant increase in the general price levels (by 12 percent) over the same period, prompting the government to enact a variety of  measures to control prices (the cost of which is unsustainable) and seek the assistance of donors to support an emergency food security program. The Government launched the Programme d'Urgence d'Appui a la Securite Alimentaire (PUASA) - the Emergency Food Security Support Program, in 2008 to address the country's immediate, short and medium term needs to increase domestic productive capacity and food security. The International Development Association (IDA)-financed Emergency Food Security Support Project (EFSSP), approved in October 2008 supported this effort and focused on immediate needs by increasing the access of cereal crop producers to fertilizer during the 2009 cropping season.

The objective of this component is to empower public and private stakeholders along selected commodity value chains to plan, design, and set-up sustainable agribusinesses. This component will provide support for the following activities: (i) developing agribusiness; (ii) linking rural agro-processing with off-grid energy sources; (iii) designing an agribusiness partial risk guarantee financing instrument to provide commercial banks and other financial institutions an incentive for lending to agribusiness; and (iv) developing and promoting weather-based risk insurance products to insure farmers against weather related risks.","theme1":{"Name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","Percent":25},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000178145","geoLocName":"West Pokot District","latitude":"1.26","longitude":"35.08","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000178440","geoLocName":"Wajir District","latitude":"1.75","longitude":"40.05","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000179068","geoLocName":"Trans Nzoia District","latitude":"1.03","longitude":"34.99","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000179585","geoLocName":"Tana River District","latitude":"-1.5","longitude":"39.5","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000179641","geoLocName":"Taita District","latitude":"-3.4","longitude":"38.37","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000180320","geoLocName":"Siaya District","latitude":"0.06","longitude":"34.29","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000184620","geoLocName":"Nakuru District","latitude":"-0.28","longitude":"36.07","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000186824","geoLocName":"Meru District","latitude":"0.06","longitude":"37.64","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000188077","geoLocName":"Makueni Location","latitude":"-1.8","longitude":"37.61","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000190106","geoLocName":"Kwale District","latitude":"-4.18","longitude":"39.45","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000191298","geoLocName":"Kisii District","latitude":"-0.75","longitude":"34.67","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000192067","geoLocName":"Kilifi","latitude":"-3.61","longitude":"39.85","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000195271","geoLocName":"Kakamega District","latitude":"0.29","longitude":"34.73","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000198474","geoLocName":"Embu District","latitude":"-0.52","longitude":"37.45","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000199987","geoLocName":"Busia District","latitude":"0.39","longitude":"34.31","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667626","geoLocName":"Butere/Mumias","latitude":"0.22","longitude":"34.48","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667658","geoLocName":"Garissa","latitude":"-0.44","longitude":"39.67","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667664","geoLocName":"Nyandarua","latitude":"-0.27","longitude":"36.38","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667665","geoLocName":"Homa Bay","latitude":"-0.516667","longitude":"34.45","country":"KE"}]},"P114291":{"id":"P114291","project_name":"Tanzania - Accelerated Food Security Project","boardapprovaldate":"2009-06-09T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"160,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND COOPERATIVES","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P114291","project_abstract":"The development objective of the Accelerated Food Security Project (AFSP) for Tanzania is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in target areas by improving farmer's access to critical agricultural inputs. The closing date for the project will be extended from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The original credit was in the amount of SDR 107.6 million (US$160 million equivalent), signed on June 9, 2009 and became effective on August 26, 2009.  The purpose of this extension request is to allow for the completion of redemption of outstanding subsidy vouchers, the completion of outstanding procurement contracts, the completion of a performance audit, and the preparation for an electronic voucher system to be piloted in 2013. During the last three years, the project has successfully distributed more than 15 million input vouchers to over 3 million farm households, supporting the purchase and application of over 500,000 tons of fertilizer and over 50,000 tons of improved seed. This has supported the production of at least 1.5 million tons of additional maize, reducing the country's dependence on grain imports and food aid.  The expanded maize production made possible by this project led to the lifting of the grains trade ban in late 2011. Project performance is currently rated as satisfactory for achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), as elaborated above.  However, overall implementation progress is assessed as moderately satisfactory due to procurement delays, and the slow settlement of the Government's counterpart funding. The latter has contributed this year to an extended delay in the payment of agro-dealers for outstanding subsidy vouchers.  The Government is now current on it counterpart funding obligations.  As of June 22, 2012 the disbursement rate stands at 95 percent with US$155.3 million of disbursed.  Key project objectives continue to be achievable. Of the project's planned US$14.3 million in procurement, US$5.4 million remains outstanding even after several procurement obligations have been dropped. This includes approximately, US$3.5 million in outstanding contracts.","theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis response","Percent":100},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000148679","geoLocName":"Kagera Region","latitude":"-2","longitude":"31.5","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000149595","geoLocName":"Tanga Region","latitude":"-5","longitude":"38.25","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000149653","geoLocName":"Tabora Region","latitude":"-5.5","longitude":"32.833333","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000149876","geoLocName":"Singida Region","latitude":"-5.5","longitude":"34.5","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000150004","geoLocName":"Shinyanga Region","latitude":"-3.75","longitude":"33","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000150442","geoLocName":"Rukwa Region","latitude":"-7","longitude":"31.5","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000150602","geoLocName":"Pwani Region","latitude":"-7","longitude":"39","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000152219","geoLocName":"Mwanza Region","latitude":"-2.75","longitude":"32.75","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000153214","geoLocName":"Morogoro Region","latitude":"-8","longitude":"37","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000154375","geoLocName":"Mbeya Region","latitude":"-8.5","longitude":"33","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000154775","geoLocName":"Mara Region","latitude":"-1.75","longitude":"34","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000155946","geoLocName":"Lindi Region","latitude":"-9.5","longitude":"38.5","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000157449","geoLocName":"Kilimanjaro Region","latitude":"-3.75","longitude":"37.75","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000157732","geoLocName":"Kigoma Region","latitude":"-5","longitude":"30","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000159067","geoLocName":"Iringa Region","latitude":"-9","longitude":"35","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000160192","geoLocName":"Dodoma Region","latitude":"-6","longitude":"36","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000160260","geoLocName":"Dar es Salaam Region","latitude":"-6.835225","longitude":"39.195973","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000161322","geoLocName":"Arusha Region","latitude":"-3","longitude":"36","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000877416","geoLocName":"Ruvuma Region","latitude":"-11","longitude":"36","country":"TZ"},{"geoLocId":"0000877744","geoLocName":"Mtwara Region","latitude":"-10.666667","longitude":"39","country":"TZ"}]},"P115952":{"id":"P115952","project_name":"Additional Financing for Tanzania Second Social Action Fund (TASAF II)","boardapprovaldate":"2009-06-09T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"30,000,000","impagency":"TANZANIA SOCIAL ACTION FUND","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P115952","project_abstract":"This emergency program paper provide credits to the Tanzania in support of its Accelerated Food Security Program. The program responds to an urgent request from the Government of Tanzania (GoT) to support its efforts to achieve greater food security by increasing food production and productivity and providing social protection for vulnerable groups and the rural poor. Tanzania is expected to feel the effects of the global economic crisis mostly through export channels (mainly tourism, regional manufacturing exports, cash crops, and natural resources) and lower capital flows from private and possibly official assistance. Because of the structure of its trade balance, which is heavily influenced by oil on the import side and gold on the export side, the net impact is likely to be lower in Tanzania than in other countries. The financial sector is mainly sound and not exposed to global toxic assets. Tanzania's agricultural sector makes major contributions to the economy and is central to food security, household income, and poverty reduction. Any slowdown in agricultural growth will affect the country's overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth and drive up food prices. Agriculture accounts for 26.5 percent of national GDP, 80 percent of employment, and 75 percent of rural household incomes. Agriculture also provides more than 95 percent of Tanzania's annual food requirement.","theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis

There are three components to the project. The first component is the improving enterprise competitiveness. This component will enhance the competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and promote broad based growth through the following three sub-components: the first subcomponent is the promoting access to business development services. The second subcomponent is the promoting tourism sector in Inhambane. Finally, the third subcomponent is the establishing a tropical fruits training center in Nampula. The second component is the improving the business enabling environment. This component will support Government of Mozambique (GoM's) effort to improve the business enabling environment. In particular, the component will advance specific reforms based on the business environment strategy, build the capacity of key agencies that can play a catalytic role in improving service provision for exports and strengthen the accounting profession. Finally, the third component is the project management, monitoring, and evaluation. The main technical counterpart for the project is the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC). MIC is the focal point for business policy reforms, has been very active in pursuing the Private Sector Development (PSD) agenda, and has requested the new operation. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established and would consist of a project coordinator, a procurement specialist, a part-time environmental specialist, a legal consultant, a financial management specialist, and a monitoring and evaluation specialist. The PIU will be located within MIC to promote ownership and would have two mandates: to carry out the project management functions in accordance with  International Development Association (IDA) guidelines and to build the capacity of MIC in these areas.","theme1":{"Name":"Trade facilitation and market access","Percent":10},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0001033354","geoLocName":"Provincia de Nampula","latitude":"-15","longitude":"39","country":"MZ"},{"geoLocId":"0001045110","geoLocName":"Provincia de Inhambane","latitude":"-23","longitude":"34.5","country":"MZ"}]},"P096648":{"id":"P096648","project_name":"Commercial Agriculture Development","boardapprovaldate":"2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"150,000,000","impagency":"STATE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P096648","project_abstract":"The objective of the Commercial Agriculture Development Project for Nigeria is to strengthen agricultural production systems and facilitate access to market for targeted value chains among small and medium scale commercial farmers in the five participating states.

The change is to drop the Output and Performance based Road Contract (OPRC) method for carrying out road construction and rehabilitation works and reverts to the traditional method of road contracting mechanism with adequate provision for maintenance. The OPRC approach is the approved approach for the implementation of the network of farm access roads sub-component of component B (improvement of rural infrastructure) under the project. This approach has been tried in Nigeria and found not to be working. Contractors cannot get the financing to pre-finance the bulk of the rehabilitation cost, and are not willing to undertake farm road construction and rehabilitation using the OPRC approach. This issue was discussed with Government during the last supervision mission and there was agreement that the OPRC approach be dropped for the classical road construction and maintenance

The objectives of the GFRP are to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food prices on the lives of the poor in a timely way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse impacts of high and more volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support broad-based growth in productivity and market participation in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply response. The operation will finance three main aspects, namely: (i) accelerated supply response of agricultural productivity to boost increased domestic food production of some selected staple food for the target groups as well as for distribution through trade and reallocation; this element will be implemented through the Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) and Local Authorities (LAs); (ii) social safety net measures targeting the food insecure households in the said six counties and implemented in tandem with the on-going Multi-Donor Trust Fund-Sudan (MDTF-S) and Sudan Recovery Fund (SRF) activities; and (iii) project implementation support to finance technical assistance, operating costs, equipment, and goods to ensure rapid and effective delivery of the proposed results.","theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis response","Percent":100},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000363656","geoLocName":"Yambio","latitude":"4.570556","longitude":"28.416389","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000365763","geoLocName":"Tonj","latitude":"7.273333","longitude":"28.683889","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000365775","geoLocName":"Tonga","latitude":"9.486944","longitude":"31.037778","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000368246","geoLocName":"Raga","latitude":"8.466667","longitude":"25.683333","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000369869","geoLocName":"Morobo","latitude":"3.691944","longitude":"30.776389","country":"SD"},{"geoLocId":"0000408650","geoLocName":"Wilayat al Wahdah","latitude":"9.5","longitude":"30","country":"SD"}]},"P113468":{"id":"P113468","project_name":"Guinea Bissau--Food Price Crisis Response Program","boardapprovaldate":"2008-09-22T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE; MINISTRY OF FINANCE","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P113468","project_abstract":"This paper reports on the development objective of the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund Program Project for Guinea Bissau, which is to improve food security for the most vulnerable population, including children, and increase smallholder rice production in project areas.

Guinea-Bissau is a fragile country, and the international community has already warned about aggravation of the food crisis in light of the coup. Once the assessment is complete, a rapid re-engagement of project implementation will contribute to alleviate the problem. The project's objectives are still achievable, and there are key implementation actions to be completed. Supervision is still ongoing to the extent possible. Due to the fact that the Bank is still assessing the situation and has not resumed communications with the government, there is currently no request from government to extend the project. The extension is motivated due to the extraordinary circumstances in the country, and as a precautionary measure, in order to give time to the Bank to assess the situation. The project development objectives are still achievable and, as indicated, there is still money to be disbursed to complete the procurement and payment of critical goods.","theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis response","Percent":100},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002371071","geoLocName":"Oio","latitude":"12.25","longitude":"-15.25","country":"GW"},{"geoLocId":"0002372533","geoLocName":"Gabu","latitude":"12.166667","longitude":"-14.083333","country":"GW"},{"geoLocId":"0002374312","geoLocName":"Cacheu","latitude":"12","longitude":"-16.166667","country":"GW"},{"geoLocId":"0002374776","geoLocName":"Bissau","latitude":"11.833333","longitude":"-15.75","country":"GW"},{"geoLocId":"0002374820","geoLocName":"Biombo","latitude":"11.833333","longitude":"-15.75","country":"GW"},{"geoLocId":"0002375255","geoLocName":"Bafata","latitude":"12.166667","longitude":"-14.75","country":"GW"}]},"P113268":{"id":"P113268","project_name":"Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project","boardapprovaldate":"2008-09-19T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, CNOP-G, MINISTRY OF PLAN","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P113268","theme1":{"Name":"Global food crisis response","Percent":100},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002420433","geoLocName":"Haute-Guinee","latitude":"10.5","longitude":"-9.5","country":"GN"},{"geoLocId":"0002420475","geoLocName":"Guinee Forestiere","latitude":"8.5","longitude":"-9","country":"GN"},{"geoLocId":"0002423334","geoLocName":"Basse-Guinee","latitude":"10","longitude":"-14","country":"GN"}]},"P107636":{"id":"P107636","project_name":"RY-GROUNDWATER & SOIL CONSERVATION ADDITIONAL FINANCING","boardapprovaldate":"2008-09-11T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"15,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P107636","project_abstract":"The objective of the Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project for Yemen is to assist the recipient in promoting groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface and groundwater availability, through: (a) the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency; (b) the improvement of recharge and protection of watersheds; and (c) the support of groundwater management framework and institutions.

Overall progress toward the achievement of the project objective is satisfactory. The last Implementation Status Report rated both Project Development Objective (PDO) and IP satisfactory. All the states have disbursed to most of the Fadama Community Associations/ Fadama User Groups (FCAs/FUGs) whose capacities have been built to implement community sub-projects. Over 4,000 productive rural infrastructure have been constructed in the fadama communities all over the federation while the 52,713 Fadama User Groups (FUGs) registered have acquired a total of 58,758 productive assets. These are significant outputs and progress towards achievement of the project objectives. About thirty identified innovative activities have been introduced into the project implementation across the states. These activities increase the level of benefits to FCAs/FUGs, enhance the achievement of the PDO and also ensure sustainability of subprojects. These innovative activities can be categorized as collaboration / partnership and sole initiatives. Such collaborations are with research institutes, farms etc. The sole initiatives include bio-gas production, improved use of ICT services etc. The project has taken commendable steps to ensure inclusive and equitable community participation at the FUG and FCA levels, thus addressing the issues of gender and governance. Steps are also being taken to strengthen the feedback loop between beneficiaries, facilitators and State Fadama Coordination Offices (SFCOs). To enable this, hotlines have been established to allow beneficiaries to report to SFCOs any cases of concerns or complaints on sub-project implementation. The relocation is to move funds from the unallocated category to civil works, goods and equipment, training and workshops, consultancies and operating cost. The low amounts in these categories are hampering the implementation of time sensitive activities in these categories.","theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic

This component will further strengthen decentralized and participatory planning at the community/kebele (sub-district) and woreda level, operating within the regional government structure. Women and men in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities will design and implement Community Action Plans (CAPs) that reflect their development priorities. The second component is the pastoral risk management. The goal of this component will be to improve the existing pastoral early warning system through a participatory approach as well as the establishment of an early response fund, and to support strategic disaster preparedness and mitigation investment planning and financing of associated subprojects. The third component is the participatory learning and knowledge management. This component will strengthen demand driven participatory learning, knowledge generation and research methodologies at the community level; and support knowledge management and information exchange or networking system at the federal and regional levels. Finally, the fourth component is the project management. This component will assist project management units at the regional and federal levels to effectively coordinate, supervise and implement project activities under the direction of the ministry of federal affairs and pastoral commissions/bureaus of each region.","theme1":{"Name":"Rural policies and institutions","Percent":16},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000444179","geoLocName":"Afar Kilil","latitude":"12","longitude":"41.5","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000444181","geoLocName":"Binshangul Gumuz Kilil","latitude":"11","longitude":"35.5","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000444183","geoLocName":"Gambela Regional State","latitude":"7.833333","longitude":"34.5","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000444185","geoLocName":"Oromiya Kilil","latitude":"8","longitude":"39","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000444186","geoLocName":"Sumale Kilil","latitude":"7","longitude":"44","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000444188","geoLocName":"Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Regional State","latitude":"6.25","longitude":"37","country":"ET"}]},"P090789":{"id":"P090789","project_name":"ET-Sustainable Land Management Program  (FY08)","boardapprovaldate":"2008-04-29T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P090789","project_abstract":"The objective of the Sustainable Land Management Project (SLM) in Ethiopia is to reduce land degradation in agricultural landscapes and to improve the agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers.

The objective of the Agricultural and Market Development component is to promote sustainable intensification and commercialization of agriculture on the irrigation schemes developed by the project. The objective of the Irrigation Management component is to enhance the efficiency and the financial sustainability of irrigation infrastructure intended for implementation and future study. Doing so will help ensure that investments in irrigation infrastructure under component one will be sustainable. The objective of the fourth component, project Management, is to manage resources in accordance with the project's objectives and procedures.","theme1":{"Name":"Rural markets","Percent":24},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000327932","geoLocName":"Lake Tana","latitude":"12","longitude":"37.333333","country":"ET"},{"geoLocId":"0000334099","geoLocName":"Irb Shet'","latitude":"11.983333","longitude":"37.566667","country":"ET"}]},"P075534":{"id":"P075534","project_name":"Integrated Ecosystem Management in the Jordan Rift Valley GEF","boardapprovaldate":"2007-06-12T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P075534","project_abstract":"The Jordan Integrated Ecosystem Management in the Jordan Rift Valley Project will apply the principles of integrated ecosystem management (IEM) to the existing land use master plan of the Jordan Rift Valley (JRV) and establish a network of well managed protected areas that meets local ecological, social and economic needs.

The cancelled funds will be redirected to other tasks in the Kenya portfolio. The cancellation of approximately 7.24 million USD is largely due to absorption capacity limitations, and is underpinned by earlier agreements with the client that the construction of the new Lower Nzoia irrigation scheme was not able to be completed within the time frame of the NRMP.

The extension will also provide additional time to implement those activities which have been slower and where mechanisms have been put in place to fast track their timely implementation. The project objectives continue to be achievable and the performance of the recipient is satisfactory with 70 percent of the grant's budget disbursed. Kenya Community Development Foundation (KCDF), the administrator, has continued to be diligent and committed to the guidelines, program strategies, objectives and desired results. Since the grant was to be administered over a period of four years, and with the loss of close to two years delay, the administrator of the grant is well within the time first envisaged as sufficient to implement the grant.

The reallocation becomes necessary after a change of procurement plan and re-estimation of the amount of funds required to finance goods procurement.","theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":28},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000932189","geoLocName":"Qoqolosing","latitude":"-28.86667","longitude":"28.18333","country":"LS"},{"geoLocId":"0000932602","geoLocName":"Mahobong","latitude":"-28.93479","longitude":"28.16387","country":"LS"},{"geoLocId":"0000932932","geoLocName":"Berea District","latitude":"-29.166667","longitude":"27.916667","country":"LS"}]},"P093721":{"id":"P093721","project_name":"Madagascar Biodiversity Corridor Carbon Finance Project","boardapprovaldate":"2006-11-22T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, WATER AND FORESTS","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P093721","theme1":{"Name":"Climate change","Percent":100},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0007910440","geoLocName":"Zahamena Ankeniheny Forest Corridor","latitude":"-18.29913","longitude":"48.64346","country":"MG"}]},"P099628":{"id":"P099628","project_name":"BioCF Kenya Greenbelt Movement","boardapprovaldate":"2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"KENYA GREENBELT MOVEMENT","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P099628","theme1":{"Name":"Other environment and natural resources management","Percent":67},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000186187","geoLocName":"Mount Kenya National Park","latitude":"-0.10187","longitude":"37.34005","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0000201330","geoLocName":"Aberdare National Park","latitude":"-0.36715","longitude":"36.65878","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007602646","geoLocName":"Muranga","latitude":"-0.7189","longitude":"37.14958","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667654","geoLocName":"Thika","latitude":"-1.04","longitude":"37.09","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667661","geoLocName":"Nyeri","latitude":"-0.42","longitude":"36.95","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667664","geoLocName":"Nyandarua","latitude":"-0.27","longitude":"36.38","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007667669","geoLocName":"Embu","latitude":"-0.52","longitude":"37.45","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007669154","geoLocName":"Maragua District","latitude":"-0.78333","longitude":"37.11667","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007733025","geoLocName":"Meru South","latitude":"-0.326841","longitude":"37.660789","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007815927","geoLocName":"Meru Central","latitude":"0.05","longitude":"37.63333","country":"KE"},{"geoLocId":"0007909891","geoLocName":"Kirinyaga","latitude":"-0.45746","longitude":"37.37474","country":"KE"}]},"P074086":{"id":"P074086","project_name":"Irrigation and Watershed Management Project","boardapprovaldate":"2006-11-14T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"30,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P074086","project_abstract":"The objective of the Irrigation and Watershed Management Project for Madagascar is to sustainably increase agricultural productivity in four high potential watershed areas and their associated irrigation schemes.

The strengthening of the project management team (through the hiring of additional consultants) and its relocation to the field have boosted the execution of activities on the ground, which in turn has resulted in much stronger involvement by and leadership of the corresponding district administrations. The restructuring is aligned with the provisions made for project supervision and the changes do not involve any changes to the project development objective. The changes are minor and cover four areas: i) adjusting the end of project target for the performance indicator on savings and loans groups to a more realistic level to account for implementation delays; ii) revising the financial agreement to reflect the remapping of the project implementing agency to a different ministry; iii) reallocating International Development Association (IDA) proceeds to finance increased project coordination costs; and iv) extend the closing date by six months to September 30, 2013, in order to align with the closing date of the co-financing from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant.

The relocation is to provide additional funds in the sum of USD of USD 374,000 and USD 920,000 to the training/workshop and incremental operating cost expenditure categories respectively to execute the identified critical activities that would ensure successful implementation and completion of the programme. The low amounts in these categories are hampering the implementation of time sensitive activities in these categories. The funding for the implementation of the forest management plans are also captured under operating cost, hence the increase in the reallocation compared to the appraisal estimate.","theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":29},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002327520","geoLocName":"Oguta Lake","latitude":"5.707057","longitude":"6.791339","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002327546","geoLocName":"Ogun State","latitude":"7","longitude":"3.583333","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002331939","geoLocName":"Lokoja","latitude":"7.8","longitude":"6.733333","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002332785","geoLocName":"Kwara State","latitude":"8.5","longitude":"5","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002333884","geoLocName":"Koton Karifi","latitude":"8.1","longitude":"6.8","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002336237","geoLocName":"Jega","latitude":"12.2175","longitude":"4.379167","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002337542","geoLocName":"Imo State","latitude":"5.5","longitude":"7.166667","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002343174","geoLocName":"Eriti","latitude":"7.728024","longitude":"5.793088","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002347468","geoLocName":"Bauchi State","latitude":"10.5","longitude":"10","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002351461","geoLocName":"Ajasse Ipo","latitude":"8.233333","longitude":"4.816667","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002597363","geoLocName":"Kebbi State","latitude":"11.5","longitude":"4","country":"NG"},{"geoLocId":"0002597364","geoLocName":"Kogi State","latitude":"7.75","longitude":"6.75","country":"NG"}]},"P070232":{"id":"P070232","project_name":"Gabon: Strengthening Capacity for Managing National Parks and Biodiversity","boardapprovaldate":"2006-03-29T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"PLAN. & MONIT.

Overall project objectives are still achievable as progress in project implementation remains satisfactory. During the last supervision mission, the review of project implementation status concluded that a reallocation of funds was necessary to fill a financial gap expected in the implementation of key project activities identified under component 'development of private irrigation' of the project. These activities concern the restructuring of the water supply network in the Niayes area, in particular the rehabilitation of the Beer Thialane irrigation network and the disconnection of boreholes in the Thiaroye area. The main purpose of these activities is to promote horticultural production in the Niayes area by establishing a performing and independently-managed irrigation scheme separate from the potable water network. The requested funds reallocation within grant and credit expenditures categories will allow to cover the updated costs of activities under relevant components and more adequately support increased horticultural and non-traditional agricultural exports in project areas.","theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":17},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002244800","geoLocName":"Region de Thies","latitude":"14.75","longitude":"-16.833333","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002244990","geoLocName":"Region de Tambacounda","latitude":"14","longitude":"-13","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002246451","geoLocName":"Region de Saint-Louis","latitude":"16.333333","longitude":"-15","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002247211","geoLocName":"Niayes","latitude":"15.416667","longitude":"-16.666667","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002248753","geoLocName":"Region de Matam","latitude":"15.5","longitude":"-13.5","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002249221","geoLocName":"Region de Louga","latitude":"15.333333","longitude":"-15.583333","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002249394","geoLocName":"Lampsar","latitude":"16.1075","longitude":"-16.34528","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002250804","geoLocName":"Region de Kaolack","latitude":"14","longitude":"-15.25","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002251910","geoLocName":"Region de Fatick","latitude":"14.25","longitude":"-16.5","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002252308","geoLocName":"Region de Diourbel","latitude":"14.75","longitude":"-16.25","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002253350","geoLocName":"Region de Dakar","latitude":"14.75","longitude":"-17.333333","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0002254443","geoLocName":"Bakel","latitude":"14","longitude":"-12.75","country":"SN"},{"geoLocId":"0006941948","geoLocName":"Senegal River","latitude":"16.578288","longitude":"-14.540405","country":"SN"}]},"P086886":{"id":"P086886","project_name":"Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation","boardapprovaldate":"2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"25,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF FISH WEALTH","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P086886","project_abstract":"The Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation Project for Yemen will contribute to achieve economic growth through the development of the fisheries sector.

During the suspension period Government of Mali (GoM) took concrete actions, including funding arrangements to secure the smooth continuation of the implementation activities. Therefore, the project continued to perform well, i.e. the construction program of the market oriented infrastructure which is critically important for the likely achievement of the project overall performance and its developmental outcomes, has been partially funded and is under implementation; (ii) a limited and slight reallocation of the credit proceeds to align project allocation of funds with the projected paths of activities and ensure that the desired outcomes will remain likely to be achieved. An effective enhancement of project's outcomes will be targeted through a well-balanced transfer of funds between categories to adequately cover those more in need of supplemental funds. The underlying rationale is that, during the extension period, the whole process will be fully funded from the available resources only, i.e. through: (a) the use of available GoM resources such as those of the guarantee funds and/or potential new GoM resources allocations; (b) any possible cost reductions as made possible by the evolving project context; and (c) a to be made, available retroactive financing under the upcoming additional financing.","theme1":{"Name":"Export development and competitiveness","Percent":29},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0002451184","geoLocName":"Region de Sikasso","latitude":"10.916667","longitude":"-7","country":"ML"},{"geoLocId":"0002451477","geoLocName":"Region de Segou","latitude":"14","longitude":"-6","country":"ML"},{"geoLocId":"0002453347","geoLocName":"Region de Mopti","latitude":"14.666667","longitude":"-4","country":"ML"},{"geoLocId":"0002454532","geoLocName":"Region de Koulikoro","latitude":"14","longitude":"-7.75","country":"ML"}]},"P078138":{"id":"P078138","project_name":"Community-Based Ecosystem Management Project","boardapprovaldate":"2005-06-28T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"0","impagency":"MINISTRY OF LAND MANAGEMENT, URBANISM AND HABITAT","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P078138","project_abstract":"The objective of the Community Based Ecosystem Management Project is to restore some of the most fragile ecosystems, by enabling local communities to better fight desertification, rehabilitate degraded lands, and protect biodiversity.

The approach to land reform piloted under the project includes (i) voluntary acquisition by communities of land sold by willing estate owners, transferred to communities by government, or donated by private individuals); (ii) on-farm development, including the establishment of shelter, and the purchase of basic inputs and necessary advisory services; and (iii) land administration, viz. the regularization, titling, and registration of beneficiaries' property rights in land. The project has the following four components: Component 1) will be implemented with direct community involvement in identification and negotiation of land acquisition and the preparation of farm development proposals. Community proposals for acquiring land and farm development would be reviewed and approved - taking into account legal, technical, environmental, and poverty reduction criteria-by a district-level multi-stakeholder entity. Component 2) secure title will be provided to the beneficiaries. The communities will decide under what property rights regime they wish to register their land and how to distribute land among participating households, which could include the registration of individual plots, if requested by the community. Component 3) will finance public information campaigns, community mobilization, participatory rural appraisal, training and technical support to communities, district and national participating institutions and stakeholders. Component 4) will finance project administration, coordination, supervision, monitoring and evaluation.","theme1":{"Name":"Participation and civic engagement","Percent":17},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000925788","geoLocName":"Mulanje District","latitude":"-16","longitude":"35.58333","country":"MW"},{"geoLocId":"0000927245","geoLocName":"Mangochi District","latitude":"-14.5","longitude":"35.25","country":"MW"},{"geoLocId":"0000927642","geoLocName":"Machinga District","latitude":"-14.91667","longitude":"35.66667","country":"MW"},{"geoLocId":"0000930283","geoLocName":"Thyolo District","latitude":"-16.16667","longitude":"35.16667","country":"MW"}]},"P074413":{"id":"P074413","project_name":"Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project","boardapprovaldate":"2004-02-26T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"40,000,000","impagency":"MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P074413","project_abstract":"The Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) is designed to test innovative solutions to the critical groundwater problem in Yemen. The problem of unsustainable groundwater extraction has been caused by the rapid spread of groundwater irrigation, combined with dwindling rates of recharge. The root cause is a weak management framework ill-adapted to ensuring sustainable extraction levels, efficient water use, and watershed protection. The project has the following three components. Component 1) will provide for the supply and installation of buried PVC and overground galvanized iron (GI) pipes to improve water conveyance and distribution efficiency. It would also provide localized on-farm irrigation systems (drip, bubbler or sprinkler) for a part of the project area to further reduce on-farm water losses. Specifically, this component would involve: (a) improving irrigation conveyance efficiency on about 27,000 ha through the supply and installation of groundwater conveyance pipes; and (b) modernization and improvement of localized on-farm irrigation efficiency. Component 2) will provide gabion baskets and other materials for the selective improvement of traditional small and medium spate schemes within identified wadis to improve spate conveyance, diversion efficiency, and groundwater recharge, in addition to associated wadi bank protection for villages. I t would also involve rehabilitation of terraces to conserve soils from water erosion and water harvesting structures, and divert run-off water for irrigation and recharge the groundwater. This would specifically involve: (a) Small and medium-scale spate irrigation improvement and rehabilitation in the wadis, and (b) Improvement of water harvesting and soil conservation works in the uplands. Component 3) will provide project implementation support, monitoring and evaluation activities, and institutional and capacity building support in the form of training and facilities to institutions involved in the project. The components consist of: (a) Capacity building (equipment, vehicles, materials, office buildings, technical assistance, training, project management and incremental operating costs). (b) Capacity building and technical assistance for local communities in project areas.","theme1":{"Name":"Water resource management","Percent":50},"locations":[{"geoLocId":"0000070222","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Ta`izz","latitude":"13.5","longitude":"44","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000070935","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Shabwah","latitude":"15","longitude":"47","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000071132","geoLocName":"Sanaa","latitude":"15.260691","longitude":"44.424895","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000071333","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Sa`dah","latitude":"17.063405","longitude":"43.914884","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000073200","geoLocName":"Muhafazat al Mahwit","latitude":"15.391981","longitude":"43.536162","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000075411","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Hadramawt","latitude":"16","longitude":"49","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000076183","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Dhamar","latitude":"14.682965","longitude":"44.272937","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000079416","geoLocName":"Muhafazat al Hudaydah","latitude":"14.917317","longitude":"43.192788","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000079838","geoLocName":"Muhafazat al Bayda'","latitude":"14.34166","longitude":"45.394422","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0000080425","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Abyan","latitude":"13.6291","longitude":"46.126","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0006201193","geoLocName":"Muhafazat ad Dali`","latitude":"13.8924","longitude":"44.7625","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0006201194","geoLocName":"Muhafazat `Amran","latitude":"16.230218","longitude":"43.909834","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0006201195","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Hajjah","latitude":"16","longitude":"43.25","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0006201196","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Ibb","latitude":"14","longitude":"44.166667","country":"RY"},{"geoLocId":"0006201197","geoLocName":"Muhafazat Lahij","latitude":"13.166667","longitude":"44.583333","country":"RY"}]},"P083082":{"id":"P083082","project_name":"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Project","boardapprovaldate":"2003-12-16T00:00:00Z","totalamt":"32,000,000","impagency":"NIGERIAN INVESTMENT PROMOTION COMMISSION","url":"http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P083082","project_abstract":"The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Project in Nigeria aims to increase the performance and employment levels of MSMEs in selected non-oil industry sub-sectors and in pilot areas of the country.
